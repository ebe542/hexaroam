# Pico hardware tests

These are separately selected firmware programs, evaluated manually on a Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040 and an oscilloscope. They are not host unit tests and are not executed by cargo test or the normal development check or verify task. Cargo registers them as example targets with explicit paths in Cargo.toml.

## Setup

Use unloaded GP0 and GP1 with no servos connected. Connect oscilloscope probes to these outputs and reference both channels to Pico GND. Use DC coupling to distinguish a persistent Low level from missing trigger activity. The current instrument is a Leader 1041 two-channel analog oscilloscope; a single startup pulse sequence may not be visible.

## Build and convert

From the repository root:

```bash
python tools/dev.py hardware-build
```

This builds all registered hardware-test programs and converts each reported ELF executable to UF2. It requires the embedded Rust target and elf2uf2-rs. It does not flash the Pico or evaluate results. Files are generated under:

```text
firmware/pico/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/examples/
```

To build and convert just one program, run from firmware/pico:

```bash
cargo run --locked --example underflow_missing_counter --features hardware-tests
```

Transfer the selected UF2 using BOOTSEL and the RPI-RP2 drive as described in the [firmware guide](../../README.md). Each transfer replaces the currently installed firmware. Reboot or transfer a fresh image to begin another run. The normal demo remains available through python tools/dev.py uf2 from the repository root.

## Programs and manual checks

| Program | Procedure and expected result |
| --- | --- |
| fixed_plan | Observe continuous approximately 1-ms High pulses on GP0 and 2-ms High pulses on GP1, with synchronous rising edges and a nominal 20-ms period. LED phases are approximately 500 ms. Measure the period separately. |
| underflow_missing_entry | Initially observe the normal pulse sequence. At approximately 5 s, DMA rearming is paused and both outputs must settle Low. LED phases change to 100 ms when PIO IRQ flag 0 is set. After 10 s, servicing resumes but both outputs must remain Low. |
| underflow_missing_counter | The first transfer ends after the final mask, omitting its counter. PIO must force Low and latch its error flag. LED phases become 100 ms. Servicing starts after 1 s; outputs must remain Low. The initial one-off pulse sequence may be too brief to observe. |
| switching_signal_plans | Alternate GP0/GP1 between 1 ms/2 ms and 2 ms/1 ms approximately once per second. Rising edges remain synchronous; nominal period is 20 ms. An immediate second submission must return Busy. Normal LED phases are 500 ms, fault phases 100 ms; a failed assertion halts execution. |

Fast blinking means the program observed PIO IRQ flag 0; it is not a calibrated timing measurement. The fault tests establish persistent electrical Low behavior, not a safe mechanical posture or servo position feedback. They do not test controlled recovery, which is not implemented yet.

## Shared support and feature boundary

support/mod.rs initializes board clocks, GPIO ownership, and the hardware timer. fixed_plan reuses the normal servo_demo. The underflow and switching tests share support/output.rs for the fixed two-output plan, static storage, and nonblocking LED indicator; each test keeps its own execution sequence.

The Pico hardware-tests feature forwards to servo-pio/hardware-tests. Only that feature exposes start_with_missing_final_counter and compiles its truncation mode. Normal start_fixed continues to transfer complete plans. The missing-entry test requires no driver fault injection: it deliberately pauses service calls. No production source edits are needed to select or repeat these experiments.

## Reported verification

On 2026-10-17 the owner reported:

- The fixed-plan demo produced approximately 1 ms and 2 ms High durations with synchronous rising edges.
- The separately selected missing-entry test behaved as described.
- The missing-counter test appeared to enter fault mode immediately; no startup edges were visible. This matches the expected millisecond-scale fault, but no precise fault latency was measured.
- The earlier full verification passed 121 host unit tests, and hardware-build created the UF2 files. The owner subsequently reported green CI for the hardware-test and task-splitting revisions.
- The two-buffer revision passed 128 unit tests and hardware-test builds. switching_signal_plans ran as expected with synchronous rising edges and alternating High durations. Continued execution also indicates that its Busy assertion did not halt the program.

The 128 unit-test total excludes these manually evaluated firmware programs. New exact period measurements, worst-case DMA service latency, 18-channel output, controlled recovery, and attached-servo operation have not been established. Remote CI for the two-buffer switching revision has not yet been reported.
